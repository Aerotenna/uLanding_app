## Cordova BLE Plugin

This plugin implements BLE support for Android, iOS and Windows 8.1. Enable your Cordova and PhoneGap mobile applications to communicate with all sorts of BLE devices.

Available functionality:

* Scan for BLE devices
* Establish connections
* List services, characteristics and descriptors
* Read and write the values of characteristics and descriptors
* Request notification of changes to the values of characteristics
* Poll RSSI (signal strength) of a device (Android and iOS only)

### Use Evothings Studio for fast and easy BLE mobile app development

This plugin is used in Evothings Studio, and is compatible with Apache Cordova and PhoneGap.

[Evothings Studio](http://evothings.com) is a development and prototyping tool for making Cordova/PhoneGap apps. With Evothings Studio the edit/run turn-around cycle is just a second or two, which is much faster compared to the traditional method of rebuilding the Cordova project for each update.

See [Evothings Examples](http://evothings.com/doc/examples/examples.html) for comprehensive examples of mobile apps that communicate over Bluetooth Low Energy, and which you can use for your own projects to get quickly up and running.
